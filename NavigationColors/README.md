NavigationColors
================

An app that demonstrates the navigationItem and barButtonItem

### Step 1: There is only one step
- Add a method “color” that changes the background color to blue then back to white when called
- Initialize a barButtonItem with self as target and color: as the selector
- Set the barButtonItem to the navigationItem's rightBarButtonItem
